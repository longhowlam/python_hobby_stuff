1
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:07,001
Jackie: (Exhales)
What the hell was that for?

2
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,001
Shall I call security,
or do you think

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,001
you can control yourself?
Stephanie: Are you proud

4
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,081
of yourself,
stealing from us?

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,028
Jackie: Was something stolen?
Stephanie: "Was something

6
00:00:16,028 --> 00:00:19,025
stolen?"
Oh, don't you pretend with me.

7
00:00:19,025 --> 00:00:25,058
How could you stoop so low?
Ridge: Well, don't feel bad.

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,058
What else could you have done?
Your mom just came in.

9
00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:30,058
I'm on the phone with bridget.
Brooke: (Sighs)

10
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:32,058
Ridge: It's all true.
Brooke: (Sighs)

11
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:43,068
Jackie m. Stole our line.
Pam: (Sobbing)

12
00:00:43,068 --> 00:00:45,091
Nick: Pam, are you okay?
Pam: (Gasps)

13
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,048
Oh! Oh, Nick. I'm sorry.
Oh, I-I didn't want you

14
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,065
to see me like this.
(Sighs)

15
00:00:50,065 --> 00:00:52,065
Nick: Well, I-I can go
if you need to--

16
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:55,071
Pam: Oh, no, please don't.
(Sniffles)

17
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:59,028
I-I-I'm really not upset.
It--I--it's just--

18
00:00:59,028 --> 00:01:02,028
in fact,
I'm really, really happy for you

19
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:05,035
and for Jackie m.
I just...

20
00:01:05,035 --> 00:01:09,001
(Sighs)
Nick: It was

21
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,001
a heck of a show today.
Pam: (Sighs)

22
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,048
(Laughs) You betcha.
(Sniffles)

23
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:15,048
(Sighs)
Nick: So you

24
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,048
having some regrets?
Pam: Not really.

25
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:21,045
Certainly not about Stephanie.
She does not deserve my loyalty.

26
00:01:21,045 --> 00:01:24,021
Nick: Mm-hmm.
Pam: But the others,

27
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,088
you know, I...
I feel a little bad.

28
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:30,061
It's kind of like
I'm making a choice

29
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:35,048
to leave my family today.
Nick: Only to join

30
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:38,088
a new family,
because you are part

31
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:46,081
of Jackie m. Now.
Pam: (Sighs)

32
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,391
(Whispers) Thanks.

00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,091
Eric: This is unbelievable.
Brooke: (Sighs)

35
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:23,091
Eric: How could Jackie
do this?

36
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:25,091
Brooke: How could Nick?
Ridge: We should have known

37
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,091
something was up
when they didn't accept

38
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:28,015
bill Spencer's deal.
Eric: Yeah.

39
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:31,025
Brooke: All of your
beautiful designs gone.

40
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,025
Hope: Hey.
I just heard. Is it true?

41
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:36,068
Brooke: I'm afraid so, honey.
Hope: The entire collection?

44
00:02:40,068 --> 00:02:42,068
Ridge: Mother's there now
trying to sort things out.

45
00:02:42,068 --> 00:02:44,068
Hope: Okay, how could they
get their hands on our designs?

46
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:48,001
We had so much security.
Brooke: We even hired

47
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,001
that new company.
Eric: No, no.

48
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:52,068
We screened that company.
Their reputation was five-star.

49
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:54,081
Brooke: So if somebody were
to come in from the outside--

50
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:56,081
Eric: No, I don't think so.
They--they would have

51
00:02:56,081 --> 00:02:58,081
caught them.
They couldn't have sneaked by.

52
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:02,038
Hope: Uh, but they did.
Ridge: I don't think so.

53
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:04,045
Brooke: Oh.
I don't like

54
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:06,045
what you're suggesting.
Ridge: It's

55
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:09,011
the only explanation.
Eric: It was somebody

56
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,078
we know.
Somebody we trust

57
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:14,045
is stealing from us.
Brooke: And selling your

58
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:17,058
beautiful designs to Jackie m.
Eric: Thousands of hours

59
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:20,051
of work.
I was proud of this collection.

60
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:22,051
Hope: Who would do this?
Uh, it's so unfair.

61
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:25,065
Eric: (Sighs)
God, it makes me sick.

62
00:03:25,065 --> 00:03:29,001
Brooke: Eric, we will find
who did this, okay?

63
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,081
Eric: (Sighs)
Oh, I'm sure we will, Brooke.

64
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:33,081
It's not gonna make me
feel any better, though.

65
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:38,038
Ridge: Or undo the damage.
Nick: With my mother?

66
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:41,065
You're sure?
No, no.

67
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:43,065
You were right to interrupt me.
Thanks for letting me know.

68
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:46,028
Pam: What--Jackie
is with Stephanie

69
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:50,021
in the building?
Nick: Backstage.

70
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,041
Pam: (Sighs)
Okay.

71
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:56,041
(Inhales sharply)
Okay, Nick.

72
00:03:56,041 --> 00:04:01,051
Time for me to face the music.
Nick: Wait.

73
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:06,045
Now let's be smart about this.
Let's think this through.

74
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,058
There's no reason
that Stephanie would know

75
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:15,061
that it's you right now.
So... why not keep it that way?

76
00:04:15,061 --> 00:04:17,041
Pam: (Sighs)
Stephanie: Is this revenge

77
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,041
because of Eric?
Jackie: (Scoffs)

78
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,041
I don't know
what you're talking about.

79
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,041
Stephanie: Well,
he--he led you to believe

80
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,041
there was a problem with our
relationship, and then he went

81
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:27,041
running to you for comfort.
Jackie: There was and he did,

82
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,011
but my heart
was far from broken.

83
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,001
Eric has bouts of courage
from time to time when he thinks

84
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:35,001
he's through with you.
Of course, people

85
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:38,005
don't believe him anymore.
I guess people

86
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:41,005
just like to be miserable.
Personally,

87
00:04:41,005 --> 00:04:45,031
I wouldn't take revenge
on a man I pity.

88
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:51,031
Stephanie: So it's me?
You hate me this much?

89
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:54,041
Jackie: I think
you might be upset,

90
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,041
because I've shown something
today that was similar

91
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:58,041
to one of your designs,
maybe a few.

92
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,041
Stephanie: Similar?
SIM--SIM--similar?

93
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:04,021
Similar?!
You stole the whole line!

94
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:07,058
Jackie: Oh, Stephanie,
fashion goes in trends.

95
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,061
You know that.
If there were similarities,

96
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:11,061
it's because of that,
and who's to say

97
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,061
that we didn't have
the same creative buzz

98
00:05:13,061 --> 00:05:16,025
at Jackie m. That you had?
Stephanie: Creative buzz?!

99
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:20,041
You haven't got a creative bone
in the whole damn building!

100
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,071
Oh, my God!
You've turned

101
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,071
into Sally spectra.
This place

102
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,071
has just become spectra,
what it used to be--

103
00:05:26,071 --> 00:05:29,041
a knock-off place.
You've stolen everything.

104
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:32,008
You've become
the queen of knock-offs.

105
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:36,091
Is that what you really want?!
Well, I guess if the crown fits,

106
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:48,015
wear it.
Eric: Oh, my God.

107
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,065
Look what she did.
She makes one--

108
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:52,065
one little change,
and she thinks she can

109
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:56,011
pass it off as her own design.
Ridge: Click on the next one.

110
00:05:56,011 --> 00:05:58,065
Brooke: Oh, no.
Eric: It's the showstopper.

111
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,065
Hope: (Sighs)
Ridge: They got everything,

112
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:04,028
every last design.
How the hell did they

113
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:19,065
get their hands on these?
(Camera shutter clicks)

114
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:24,078
Oliver: Uh, yeah, okay.
Um, well, yeah,

115
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:28,008
I-I heard it's everything,
but, uh, no one knows for sure.

116
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:31,028
I know, right?
Yeah, okay.

117
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:35,055
I-I'll tell him you called.
Sure.

118
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:37,055
Beverly: Hey, Oliver.
Oliver: Hi.

119
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,055
Beverly, right?
Beverly: Yeah.

120
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:41,055
I thought you worked down
in the photo studio.

121
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:43,055
Oliver: Yeah.
I-I'm filling in for Madison,

122
00:06:43,055 --> 00:06:45,055
who's filling in for Pam.
Things are pretty crazy

123
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:47,055
around here
if you haven't noticed.

124
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:51,005
Beverly: What's going on?
Oliver: You haven't heard?

125
00:06:51,005 --> 00:06:53,091
Beverly: No.
Oliver: Jackie m.

126
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:56,035
Just had a fashion show.
People are saying

127
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:59,001
they showed forrester designs.
Beverly: Why?

128
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,001
Who would want to buy
old designs?

129
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:04,018
Oliver: No, not old ones,
new ones,

130
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:06,018
the ones we were gonna use
in our show,

131
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:09,008
or versions of them, at least.
Beverly: Wow.

132
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:11,048
What--what--what does that mean?
Oliver: It means

133
00:07:11,048 --> 00:07:14,035
they stole from us.
It means someone here

134
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:17,078
helped them.
Whoever did it

135
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:23,058
is gonna be in serious trouble.
Pam: Well, it's not gonna be

136
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:27,001
too hard for them to figure out,
sailor, especially when they see

137
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:31,048
that I'm working here.
I mean, that's still the plan,

138
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:33,095
right?
Nick: Of course.

139
00:07:33,095 --> 00:07:38,998
But... is now the right time?
Pam: Yes.

140
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:41,071
I'm ready.
And I really need to be here,

141
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:44,998
Nick, especially now.
I can't be back at forrester

142
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:47,028
pretending that I didn't hurt
all those people.

143
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,081
Nick: No, no.
I-I understand completely.

144
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:51,081
It's--you know,
it's just a shame

145
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,011
we're gonna lose our connection
to all of those...

146
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,048
(Sighs)
Those beautiful designs...

147
00:07:56,048 --> 00:07:58,048
Pam: Yeah.
Nick: Yeah, with you

148
00:07:58,048 --> 00:08:02,011
in such a key position.
You know, Pam, you're the reason

149
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:05,051
that we had this fashion show.
Pam: You mean,

150
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:08,078
the longer I stay over there,
the longer Jackie m.

151
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:11,081
Would benefit?
Nick: Well,

152
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,081
they're gonna figure out
at some point,

153
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:19,081
but until then...
Pam: Keep... stealing?

154
00:08:23,071 --> 00:08:26,008
Nick: Let's not
do anything rash, okay?

155
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,008
Pam: Okay.
Nick: As far as we know,

156
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:32,025
Stephanie's in the building,
and we don't know if she knows,

157
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,061
and maybe she does.
Either way,

158
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:41,035
if my mother plays this right,
which I think she will...

159
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:48,005
We could be helping each other
for... a long, long time.

160
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,018
Pam: (Sighs)
Stephanie: I understood

161
00:08:50,018 --> 00:08:52,018
that you didn't want to take
the money from Spencer,

162
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:54,018
but was stealing
the only option?

163
00:08:54,018 --> 00:08:56,018
Why didn't you come to me?
Jackie: No.

164
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:59,008
You do not get to pretend
that you were available,

165
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,061
that all I had to do
was reach out and you'd come

166
00:09:01,061 --> 00:09:04,051
swooping in to help.
The moment that you thought

167
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,008
that Eric was interested in me,
you flipped that switch

168
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:09,081
in your head,
and I went from friend to foe...

169
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,035
Just like that.
You're hurting?

170
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:15,095
Well, so am I, Stephanie.
I came to your aid.

171
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:19,068
I swooped in to help you.
"Team Stephanie. Rah rah!"

172
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:21,091
You remember that?
They were fond memories.

173
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,008
Well, now they are gone.
They are over.

174
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:29,005
And all we are to each other
is competitors.

175
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,005
Stephanie: Who did you con
into stealing for you?

176
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,011
Jackie: Nobody.
Stephanie: Oh, please.

177
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:35,011
It's so apparent.
There was somebody

178
00:09:35,011 --> 00:09:37,011
on the inside.
Did you throw a ton of money

179
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,055
at them,
or did you use your sex appeal?

180
00:09:39,055 --> 00:09:41,055
Jackie: Not mine.
Stephanie: What?

181
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,055
Jackie: You have to leave,
okay?

182
00:09:43,055 --> 00:09:45,055
I have just had
the showing of my career,

183
00:09:45,055 --> 00:09:47,055
and I'm not
gonna have today ruined

184
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:49,071
by your ridiculous accusations.
Stephanie: The showing

185
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:52,035
of your career?
You stole from us!

186
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,068
You have stolen everything
from us.

187
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:58,088
You've cost us a fortune.
You...

188
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:03,081
(Sighs)
Okay, Jackie.

189
00:10:03,081 --> 00:10:08,008
I'm gonna figure this out.
I am.

190
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:10,008
I'm gonna figure out
who the accomplice is,

191
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:12,065
and when I do,
it isn't going to be pretty

192
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:18,051
for either one of you.
And you know me.

193
00:10:24,065 --> 00:10:40,005
(Door closes)
Pam: We should have heard

194
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:42,005
by now.
Nick: Well, not necessarily.

195
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:44,005
It's not like my mother can call
if Stephanie's in the middle

196
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:46,005
of a tirade.
Pam: I know,

197
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,005
but I'm--I'm worried about her.
When my sister

198
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:50,005
loses her temper--
(Gasps)

199
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:52,005
Jackie: Aha.
You heard she was here.

200
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:53,041
Pam: (Sighs)
Nick: Mother.

201
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,061
Pam: You're okay.
Jackie: Oh, yes, I'm fine.

202
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,018
I just stayed clear
of all the balconies

203
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:59,018
in the building.
Pam: Is she gone?

204
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:01,025
Jackie: Thankfully.
Pam: Whew.

205
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:04,005
Nick: Well, what happened?
Pam: Yeah, come on.

206
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:06,005
Don't keep us in suspense.
Does she know about me?

207
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:09,095
Jackie: (Scoffs)
Oh, Pam. You know Stephanie.

208
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:11,095
She doesn't ever
think about you.

209
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:14,075
Why should she start now?
Pam: (Scoffs)

210
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,075
Yeah, right.
Well, at least

211
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,071
she doesn't suspect me then?
Jackie: Not in the least.

212
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,071
Nick: There,
do you hear that?

213
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:23,071
Nothing has to change.
You continue to stay

214
00:11:23,071 --> 00:11:27,011
at forrester, be our pipeline.
Pam: Oh,

215
00:11:27,011 --> 00:11:29,011
I-I don't know, Nick.
I-I kind of thought that I'd be

216
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:31,065
free and clear of Stephanie
after today.

217
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,065
I mean, the thought
of going back there to forrester

218
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:35,065
and pretending--
Nick: No, no.

219
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:37,065
Just--just--just for
a while longer, okay,

220
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:40,048
just to see how many designs
you can actually get.

221
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:44,035
Jackie: Hmm.
Pam: Oh, I-I don't know.

222
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,051
Nick: Mother?
Jackie: Mm-hmm?

223
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:48,051
Nick: Do you think
we could have a moment?

224
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:50,051
Jackie: Yes, definitely.
I'll go and check,

225
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:52,051
see how everything's selling.
(Chuckles)

226
00:11:52,051 --> 00:12:03,071
Pam: Okay.
Nick: Pam.

227
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:06,038
Pam: Yeah?
Nick: You have

228
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:12,011
individually saved Jackie m.
Words can't really express

229
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:16,085
my gratitude.
I would really appreciate

230
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:20,021
if you continued to help us.
Pam: (Sighs)

231
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,998
Nick: So I'm asking you
to do that

232
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:24,998
for me.
Pam: (Sighs)

233
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:32,018
Nick: Please.
Brooke: We should start

234
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,018
working on a letter to the press
and let everybody know that

235
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:36,018
the show has been cancelled.
Ridge: No, just postponed.

236
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:38,018
How the hell did we get
in this position?

237
00:12:38,018 --> 00:12:39,091
(Door opens)
Eric: Stephanie.

238
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,091
Stephanie: She got
every single one of the designs.

239
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:43,091
Ridge: Yeah,
we saw the pictures.

240
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:45,091
Stephanie: When bridget
called me, I-I couldn't

241
00:12:45,091 --> 00:12:46,085
believe--I couldn't believe
what I was hearing.

242
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:48,085
Eric: It's just unbelievable.
How could Jackie do this?

243
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:50,085
Stephanie: Well,
she's a thief.

244
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:52,085
I just talked to her.
She wouldn't admit it, and she

245
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:54,028
wouldn't tell me anything.
Eric: Yeah.

246
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,038
Ridge: Obviously,
she has an insider.

247
00:12:55,038 --> 00:12:58,021
Stephanie: Yes, and I think
it behooves us to find them.

248
00:12:58,021 --> 00:13:00,028
Ridge: You're damn right
we're gonna find them.

249
00:13:00,028 --> 00:13:04,071
Hope: I think I might know.
Brooke: What?

250
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,075
Hope: She was
taking pictures, Stephanie.

251
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:10,038
I saw her.
Ridge: Of our designs?

252
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,091
Hope: You know she was.
Stephanie: Well, yes,

253
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,091
but just--it never--
Brooke: Who are you

254
00:13:14,091 --> 00:13:16,091
talking about?
Stephanie: Beverly. Beverly.

255
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,091
Hope: The new intern.
I think she stole our designs.

256
00:13:18,091 --> 00:13:35,998
Stephanie: (Sighs)
Pam: I want to keep at it

257
00:13:35,998 --> 00:13:37,998
for you,
but I've been waiting so long,

258
00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:39,998
Nick.
I have been fantasizing

259
00:13:39,998 --> 00:13:41,998
about this day
when I would

260
00:13:41,998 --> 00:13:46,021
finally tell Stephanie off.
Nick: N-no, you can't.

261
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:48,078
She doesn't know it was you.
You can't give yourself away

262
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,008
when there's so much more
that you can do, Pam.

263
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:55,008
Pam: (Sighs)
Nick: You've got

264
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,008
to make peace with Stephanie.
Pam: No! No.

265
00:13:57,008 --> 00:13:59,091
Not after the way
she treated me.

266
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,091
Nick: If you
confront her now,

267
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,091
it's over.
Don't give in

268
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,091
to that temptation.
See how far

269
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:08,038
that you can take this.
She doesn't know it was you,

270
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:11,068
and maybe she never will.
Think about what you can do

271
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:15,061
for Jackie m.
Pam: So I-I just...

272
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:17,085
Go back there?
Nick: Just as if

273
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:20,091
nothing's changed.
Pam: Put a big smile

274
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:23,058
on my face for Stephanie
and answer the phones,

275
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:27,055
pour coffee, bake for them?
No, Nick.

276
00:14:27,055 --> 00:14:30,028
This is where I belong now,
not there.

277
00:14:30,028 --> 00:14:32,028
Nick: And you will be here.
Pam: (Sighs)

278
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:35,058
Nick: And we'll be meeting
all the time.

279
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:38,025
Pam: I can't do it.
I can't.

280
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:41,088
It--it's one thing if I'm here,
but being back over there

281
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:46,015
and looking in their faces,
the people I betrayed--

282
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,061
Eric, ridge,
my nieces and nephews.

283
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:52,068
I-I can't.
I-I...

284
00:14:52,068 --> 00:14:54,071
I can't.
Nick: You can.

285
00:14:54,071 --> 00:15:11,038
Pam: (Sighs)
Nick: Can't you?

286
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:16,071
Nick: Now I want you
to go back to forrester,

287
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:20,091
make nice with Stephanie...
Pam: (Inhales sharply)

288
00:15:20,091 --> 00:15:22,091
Nick: And act like
you have nothing to do...

289
00:15:22,091 --> 00:15:24,091
Pam: (Sighs)
Nick: With stealing

290
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:26,091
those designs.
Pam: When you kiss me

291
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,091
like that,
I feel like

292
00:15:28,091 --> 00:15:34,051
there's nothing I can't do.
Okay.

293
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:37,031
Okay.
I'll go back.

294
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:39,058
I'll take the designs.
Heck, I'll take office supplies

295
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:41,081
if you need them.
Nick: No, no. No, no.

296
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:43,081
Pam: No?
(Laughs)

297
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:45,008
Nick: The designs are--
the designs are fine.

298
00:15:45,008 --> 00:15:46,048
Pam: Okay.
Nick: You might want

299
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:46,085
to get back over there.
You'll--with all the mayhem,

300
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:48,085
they'll notice
if somebody's missing

301
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:51,085
and get suspicious.
Pam: One more little kiss,

302
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:57,018
you know, for courage?
Nick: For courage.

303
00:15:57,018 --> 00:16:02,021
Pam: Yeah.
Mwah!

304
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:04,021
Okeydokey, sailor man.
Nick: (Laughs)

305
00:16:04,021 --> 00:16:06,021
Ah.
Pam: I am on a mission now.

306
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:07,048
Nick: Oh.
Pam: I will be that Pammy

307
00:16:07,048 --> 00:16:10,055
that everybody knows and loves.
Nobody will suspect a thing.

308
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:12,055
Oh, hello, Jackie.
Jackie: (Gasps) Oh!

309
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,055
Pam: Toodles. Can't talk now.
I got a company to keep afloat.

310
00:16:14,055 --> 00:16:18,045
Nick: (Laughs)
Jackie: She's heading

311
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,051
back to forrester?
Nick: Yes, she is.

312
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:25,005
She decided to, uh, continue
helping us and bring designs

313
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:28,025
as long as she can.
Jackie: So how did you

314
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:30,025
convince her?
What did you say?

315
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:35,038
Or was it something
you did?

316
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:39,015
Nick: (Smacks lips)
Jackie: Mm-hmm.

317
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:42,075
Nick: (Pops lips)
Eric: When she gets back,

318
00:16:42,075 --> 00:16:46,001
send her up here right away.
Ridge: Suspicious,

319
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,001
to say the least.
Hope: Yeah, I mean,

320
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:49,048
who does that?
Who takes pictures

321
00:16:49,048 --> 00:16:50,091
of the designs?
Brooke: But if she

322
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:52,091
didn't know not to...
Eric: Look,

323
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:54,091
how--how did she react when--
when you called her on it?

324
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:56,091
Did she seem like she was lying?
Stephanie: No.

325
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:58,998
No, not at all.
As a matter of fact,

326
00:16:58,998 --> 00:17:00,998
she apologized immediately.
She was very genuine

327
00:17:00,998 --> 00:17:02,998
and straightforward.
Honestly, I never thought

328
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:04,998
to question.
(Laughs)

329
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:06,998
(Knock on door)
Stephanie: She's here.

330
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:08,998
Eric: All right.
Let's not, uh,

331
00:17:08,998 --> 00:17:10,998
jump all over her, all right?
Be careful.

332
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,998
Hope: I think
it's pretty obvious.

333
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,998
Eric: (Sighs)
(Knock on door)

334
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:20,005
Beverly: Hello?
Ridge: Come in.

335
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,011
Beverly: Hi.
I-I was told you

336
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:23,011
were looking for me.
Brooke: We have

337
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:26,018
some questions.
Ridge: Close the door.

338
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:36,081
Beverly: Something's wrong.
Is this about

339
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:40,028
the Jackie m. Fashion show?
Stephanie: I have something

340
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:42,058
I'd like to ask you.
And, Beverly, I want you

341
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:45,048
to tell me the truth.
Beverly: Okay.

342
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:47,048
Stephanie: Did you
take our designs

343
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:50,065
and sell them to Jackie marone?
Beverly: What?!

344
00:17:50,065 --> 00:17:52,065
Stephanie: Did you?
Beverly: Mrs. forrester.

345
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:54,998
Stephanie: Just answer
the question--yes or no.

346
00:17:54,998 --> 00:17:56,998
Hope: I saw you, Beverly,
taking pictures

347
00:17:56,998 --> 00:18:00,051
of the entire collection.
Beverly: Yeah,

348
00:18:00,051 --> 00:18:02,051
a-and I explained.
Hope: I know--I know you did,

349
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:05,061
that you--you didn't know
any better.

350
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:08,035
But that's not good enough
right now, okay?

351
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:11,021
Because all
of their really hard work

352
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:14,998
has just ended up
on the Jackie m. Runway.

353
00:18:14,998 --> 00:18:18,015
Somebody stole from us.
Somebody handed over

354
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:23,048
every single one of our designs
to the marones.

355
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,081
Was it you?
Did you steal

356
00:18:25,081 --> 00:18:28,239
our entire collection?

357
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:46,460
