Thorne tries to convince Macy to forget about her father and to follow her heart. Lorenzozo rushes to the door and tells Macy not to listen to Thorne because he has let her down before. \\n\\n\\nWhile watching the final entries for the fashion shows, Bridget tells Massimo she knows it must be hard for him to watch Ridge interact with Eric. She informs Massimo that the tribute to Taylor was Brooke's idea. Ridge tells Brooke how much he appreciates the tribute and she admits that it may be a new start for her and Thomas. Ridge agrees that it could be.\\n\\n\\nBefore the showstoppers appear, Ridge takes time to thank Eric for the distraction of the fashion competition. The introduction to the Spectra showstopper is some confetti and a huge glamour shot of Sally. This is clearly embarrassing to Ridge and gives the audience a chuckle, but it does not take away from the beautiful wedding gown. The Forrester introduction was much more classy. The model was escorted in a rowboat in the elegant wedding gown Eric designed. The crowd oohed and aahed and showed their appreciation. While Stephanie had a look of disgust on her face when she realized the model was Brooke, Ridge had a look of admiration.\\n\\n\\n\""
