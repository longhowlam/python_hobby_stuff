1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,471
<i>Previously on "The Bold Type"...</i>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,903
You're ready to introduce me
as your girlfriend,

3
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:05,598
but you're not ready to go down on me?

4
00:00:05,642 --> 00:00:07,687
I guess I was a little, uh,

5
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:09,341
worried and scared.

6
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,865
Everyone knows that Sutton
has been sleeping with him.

7
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,214
It's the only reason she's getting

8
00:00:13,258 --> 00:00:14,999
- all these styling credits.
- It's a gamble.

9
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,696
All of it. But I'm putting my money down

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,219
on my career and believing

11
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:19,699
that love will fall in place.

12
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:21,571
My first subject is Emma Cox.

13
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:23,689
I love that a customer knows
a homeless woman

14
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,878
is gonna benefit from her purchase.

15
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:26,619
Three of our clients
wound up in the hospital

16
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:28,099
- with infections.
- Jane.

17
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:31,015
So in about one minute, your vertical's
going to go live. Just a heads-up,

18
00:00:31,058 --> 00:00:32,799
- I made a few adjustments.
- Oh, shit.

19
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:39,356
- Enjoy your Squeeze Press!
- Thank you.

20
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,699
_

21
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:51,721
_

22
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:55,572
- Hey.
- Where are you?

23
00:00:55,608 --> 00:00:57,641
Squeeze Press.
At a table facing the office.

24
00:00:57,676 --> 00:01:00,677
Wait, what? I thought
we said the Midtown location?

25
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:02,479
I've been looking forward
to this all morning!

26
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:03,747
Why would we go to Midtown?

27
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:05,649
Because that's where my appointment was.

28
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:07,484
Hold on, it's Jane.

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,752
Are you at the Midtown location?

30
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:11,388
I'm at the Brooklyn location,
like we discussed.

31
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,423
- Brooklyn?
- I'm in Midtown.

32
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:15,425
Yeah, and I'm in Madison Square Park.

33
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:18,495
- I'm dying to know.
- Okay, just tell us.

34
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:19,630
- How was it?
- Well...

35
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:21,632
then you know where to find me.

36
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,600
Oh, and ladies?

37
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:25,469
- It's worth it.
- Kat!

38
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,438
First one there gets the details.

39
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:29,573
No!

40
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:30,674
- Yes, yes, yes!
- No! No!

41
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:31,554
No!

42
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,572
Oh, my God, I can't believe you guys.

43
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:46,790
- And, Jane, your shoes.
- Oh, please, she doesn't care.

44
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:48,559
Yeah, the only thing
I care about right now

45
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:51,428
is you telling us what it was like
to go down on Adena.

46
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:52,830
Go ahead.

47
00:01:53,837 --> 00:01:56,567
Well, uh, it was awesome.

48
00:01:56,602 --> 00:01:58,468
I mean, I was completely
freaked out at first.

49
00:01:58,504 --> 00:01:59,570
- Of course.
- Who wouldn't be?

50
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:00,771
Then I realized

51
00:02:00,806 --> 00:02:02,573
I have one of these,
and I know what I like.

52
00:02:02,608 --> 00:02:04,608
So, I did it.

53
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,610
And I liked it. A lot.

54
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:08,345
- Ooh!
- That's amazing.

55
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,647
And things with Adena are awesome.

56
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:13,617
- God, I miss Richard sex.
- Oh, babe.

57
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:14,992
You just need a distraction.

58
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:16,687
I just want to like a guy again,
you know?

59
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:17,728
Yeah.

60
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:19,526
Oh, great.

61
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,725
- I have to go deal with this Emma Cox takedown.
- _

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,012
Actually, we have to go too.

63
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,561
- Jacqueline pitch meeting.
- All right.

64
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,430
Uh, hey. Baby?

65
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:28,732
The Emma Cox thing is gonna be fine.

66
00:02:28,767 --> 00:02:30,801
- Mm...
- Mm-kay.

67
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:33,403
Guys, are you gonna
walk with me like this?

68
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,738
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

69
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:36,346
Off to work.

70
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,516
Hey, Victoria. Do you have a second?

71
00:02:46,552 --> 00:02:48,585
What's up?

72
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:51,822
My piece on Emma Cox
is completely different

73
00:02:51,857 --> 00:02:54,391
than what I handed in.

74
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:56,727
Do you know why
we call this place "Incite"?

75
00:02:56,762 --> 00:03:00,364
- Because it...
- Because we incite conversations.

76
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,633
Your nuanced piece on when
good intentions go bad

77
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:03,813
didn't do that.

78
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,471
But the part where Emma Cox
brands OTR as charitable,

79
00:03:07,506 --> 00:03:10,307
even after her product
makes homeless women sick

80
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:11,475
<i>was</i> interesting.

81
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,677
So I made that the article.

82
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:15,445
I get that. Um...

83
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:17,648
It's just, you hired me for my voice...

84
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:19,919
When it aligns with "Incite's" brand.

85
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,719
You just missed the mark this time.

86
00:03:22,755 --> 00:03:24,488
I just wish that I would have seen it

87
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:26,356
before it went live.
At... at "Scarlet"...

88
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:28,659
This is not "Scarlet," Jane.

89
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:33,764
Right.

90
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:37,367
Another hero caught
beating off on camera.

91
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:39,469
How hard is it to keep
your junk in your trunk?

92
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,405
I don't think you're using that right.

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,340
- Not the point.
- When in doubt,

94
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,741
- don't pull it out.
- Exactly.

95
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:46,510
Not that hard.

96
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:49,346
Ooh, I do not envy any of you

97
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,715
having to navigate
dating in this climate.

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,519
So there is something else
that we need to talk about.

99
00:03:55,554 --> 00:03:57,354
Our allies.

100
00:03:57,389 --> 00:03:59,723
The guys who show up at women's rallies,

101
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,292
and who speak up when others are silent.

102
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:05,495
I want to do a roundup of honorable men.

103
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:07,664
Good doctors, firefighters,

104
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,433
human rights activists.

105
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:10,667
Alex, you'll do the interviews.

106
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:12,636
And we'll make it a fashion spread.

107
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:14,504
Can't we just do a write-up?

108
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,574
You know how I hate styling
the general population.

109
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,409
I have faith in you, Oliver.

110
00:04:19,445 --> 00:04:21,445
And you have a great support staff.

111
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,348
And a meditation app, if you need it.

112
00:04:24,383 --> 00:04:26,550
Kat, we need to bank some content

113
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:29,453
for Snapchat, and this photo shoot
will be a perfect place to start.

114
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:31,388
Hashtag "they're not all bad,"

115
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:32,756
you know... you make that better.

116
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,875
- Yeah.
- All right, so,

117
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:36,526
what's in the hopper for our
"Love and Lust" section?

118
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:38,662
Uh, household appliances
that will charge up

119
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,365
- your sex life.
- Electric toothbrush.

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,600
What?

121
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,469
What, nobody else...

122
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,771
And a Waterpik.

123
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:49,473
- People still use those?
- They will,

124
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:50,640
- after they read my article.
- Hmm.

125
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:52,542
- Give me your top six.
- Sure.

126
00:04:52,578 --> 00:04:53,744
All right, everyone, that's it.

127
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:56,446
Uh, Kat, can you hang back for a moment?

128
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,681
Sure.

129
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,745
Now that you are a department head,

130
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,586
I'm going to need your bio

131
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,389
for speaking engagements
and media tie-ins.

132
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:07,424
I really want you out there
as the face of social.

133
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,292
- Great.
- You do have a bio, right?

134
00:05:09,328 --> 00:05:10,761
I have...

135
00:05:10,796 --> 00:05:13,363
a Twitter bio and an Insta bio.

136
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,631
All right, well,
I'm gonna need something

137
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,433
a little bit more professional.
You know,

138
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:18,468
just a couple paragraphs,
make it interesting.

139
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,437
People are gonna want to
know who Kat Edison is.

140
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:21,571
Okay.

141
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,607
Richard. Good to see you.

142
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,542
To what do I owe this honor?

143
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:29,312
A board seat just became available.

144
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:32,682
Oh. Did someone die, or move to Boca?

145
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:35,719
Stanley Rogers retired
to spend more time with his family.

146
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:37,554
And you're telling me this because...

147
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,689
I think you should go for it.

148
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:41,425
It'd be a lot of fun
to have you upstairs.

149
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,760
We could really
shake things up from the inside.

150
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:46,463
Mm, that would be fun,
and I love the idea

151
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:47,731
of another woman being upstairs.

152
00:05:47,766 --> 00:05:49,533
But you and I both know
I'm not leaving "Scarlet."

153
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,334
Unless, of course,
that's no longer a conflict.

154
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,670
No, it is.

155
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,165
I figured it was a long shot,

156
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:56,573
but you can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

157
00:05:57,776 --> 00:05:59,509
Well, keep me updated on who they find.

158
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,744
Of course.

159
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,280
Everything else good?

160
00:06:03,315 --> 00:06:04,614
Yeah, good enough.

161
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,520
Red. Men like you.

162
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:12,756
Walk with me.

163
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,658
- Figures.
- You don't know this,

164
00:06:14,693 --> 00:06:16,326
well, because you're young,

165
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:20,330
but styling the general population
is hell, even if they are handsome.

166
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,565
Which is why I want you
to be my right hand.

167
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,433
- Got it.
- And my left.

168
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:25,469
Here's your binder of extraordinary men.

169
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:27,370
Pick five who can be
here in the morning.

170
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,406
- Tomorrow morning?
- You'll need to fit them.

171
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:32,509
These are not models,
so they are not one size fits all.

172
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:35,712
Oh, and Red, these guys are amateurs
when it comes to photo shoots,

173
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:38,648
so they're going to need
a lot of hand-holding.

174
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:40,684
You're welcome.

175
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:55,762
_

176
00:06:56,668 --> 00:06:58,335
"Emma Cox is a fraud."

177
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,736
Oh, my God, this is crazy.

178
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:01,738
Are "Incite" readers always this harsh?

179
00:07:01,773 --> 00:07:03,473
Yep.

180
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:05,408
And I take it you don't agree with them.

181
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:08,311
Yeah, because they only
have one side of the story.

182
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:11,314
I mean, she did one bad thing,
and it wasn't on purpose.

183
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,316
Oof! Brutal.

184
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,684
Come on, we have a pitch meeting.

185
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,321
Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

186
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,393
_

187
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:35,405
<i>Hi, this is Emma Cox.</i>

188
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,673
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

189
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,644
Hi, Emma. This is Jane Sloan
from "Incite." I just wanted to say

190
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:42,379
<i>how sorry I am.</i>

191
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,648
Ooh, working on your bio?

192
00:07:44,683 --> 00:07:46,383
Kind of.

193
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:50,787
Is that Susan and Marcus?

194
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:52,589
Yeah.

195
00:07:55,661 --> 00:07:57,494
Huh.

196
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,662
I want you to meet them.

197
00:07:58,697 --> 00:08:00,580
I'm supposed to have dinner
with them tomorrow night,

198
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:04,367
so maybe we could
invite them over, or...

199
00:08:04,403 --> 00:08:05,669
Um...

200
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:08,605
are you sure you want me to be there?

201
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,707
I know you've never introduced
anyone you were dating

202
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:12,309
to your parents before.

203
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:13,743
Yes, I'm sure.

204
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,513
Not to mention, a woman.

205
00:08:17,516 --> 00:08:20,383
They know. They're cool.

206
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:23,587
They want to meet the
person I'm crazy about.

207
00:08:23,622 --> 00:08:26,389
Okay.

208
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:28,558
Then, uh, I'd better do my research.

209
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,594
Mm-hmm.

210
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:35,732
Each page just keeps
getting better and better.

211
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,734
Their careers are very impressive.

212
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,536
Who are you? "Their careers

213
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:41,404
are very impressive?"
Have you even looked

214
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,117
- at this binder?
- It's a binder of professional men.

215
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:46,710
It is a binder of hot men,

216
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,511
and you get to fit them.

217
00:08:48,547 --> 00:08:49,809
Because men like me.

218
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,581
Okay, someone's cocky.

219
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:53,683
Oliver's words, not mine.

220
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,586
Do you think Oliver wants my help
because he heard people talking,

221
00:08:56,622 --> 00:08:58,355
and he thinks I'm the office flirt?

222
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,656
No.

223
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:02,525
I think he wants your help
because you're good at your job.

224
00:09:02,561 --> 00:09:04,327
- All right.
- But that doesn't mean

225
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:08,298
you can't still enjoy some eye candy
with your best friend.

226
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,566
How cute is this guy?

227
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:11,434
And he's a doctor.

228
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,470
With a free clinic.

229
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:14,979
I think I have an itch.

230
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,740
You do know this is a
round-up of good guys

231
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:18,608
in light of all the
sexual harassment claims?

232
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:20,644
Oh, and I'm objectifying them.

233
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,712
Yeah.

234
00:09:22,748 --> 00:09:24,748
I see the irony, and I'm okay with it.

235
00:09:24,783 --> 00:09:26,549
Why did I leave "Scarlet," again?

236
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,518
Because you wanted to do
hard-hitting journalism.

237
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:30,253
Well, you know what I would hit hard?

238
00:09:30,434 --> 00:09:31,721
That.

239
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:33,096
Oh, what is this?

240
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,782
What's "Sorry Not Sorry Jane Sloan"?

241
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,367
It's getting retweeted like crazy.

242
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:46,436
<i>Hi, Emma. This is Jane Sloan
from "Incite." I just wanted to say</i>

243
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:47,637
<i>how sorry I am.</i>

244
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:48,925
<i>That's not the article I wrote.</i>

245
00:09:49,008 --> 00:09:51,308
<i>It was turned into a total hit piece.</i>

246
00:09:51,343 --> 00:09:52,490
- Call Kat.
- Yeah.

247
00:09:52,544 --> 00:09:53,832
<i>If you could give me a
call when you get this,</i>

248
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:54,812
<i>that would be great.</i>

249
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:01,798
Great. 956 retweets.

250
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,063
How could she do this?

251
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,717
She put my voicemail on Twitter.

252
00:10:05,801 --> 00:10:07,535
Why would she humiliate me like this?

253
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,504
I was trying to apologize.

254
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,606
Maybe I should just email
her my original article,

255
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,041
- and she'll take it down.
- No.

256
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:15,714
Have you learned nothing
from this experience?

257
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,511
Well, I should at least email Victoria

258
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:18,579
- and tell her what happened...
- Hey!

259
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:19,680
- Do not touch...
- No, no.

260
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:21,549
...the computer.

261
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,517
- But Victoria is...
- Will handle it.

262
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,319
Remember when the stripper sued you?

263
00:10:25,354 --> 00:10:26,520
Jacqueline took care of it.

264
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:27,688
This is way above your pay grade.

265
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:29,623
Wonderful.

266
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:31,592
"Sorry Not Sorry" is trending.

267
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:32,793
Not the Demi Lovato version.

268
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:35,362
Yeah, but it's totally gonna blow over.

269
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:36,597
- Right, Kat?
- Absolutely.

270
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:38,332
These things have a 24-hour lifespan.

271
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,433
<i>Just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

272
00:10:39,468 --> 00:10:40,668
<i>so-so-sorry I am.</i>

273
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,436
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

274
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:43,804
<i>This is Jane-Jane-Jane</i>

275
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,639
<i>Jane-Jane-Jane Sloan.
I just wanted to say</i>

276
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,675
<i>how sorry... so-so-sorry I am.</i>

277
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,543
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

278
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:52,346
<i>This is Jane-Jane-Jane
Jane-Jane-Jane Sloan.</i>

279
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:53,581
<i>I just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

280
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,482
<i>- so-so-sorry I am.</i>
- Sorry.

281
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:57,484
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

282
00:10:58,688 --> 00:10:59,753
It's not funny.

283
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:07,628
Hi, can I help you?

284
00:11:07,663 --> 00:11:10,331
Tim Benson. NYFD lieutenant.

285
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:11,599
Sage, "Scarlet" sex writer.

286
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,434
I'm here for a fitting.

287
00:11:13,469 --> 00:11:14,668
- We all are.
- Okay.

288
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:16,537
Oh, right!

289
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,439
Right, uh,

290
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:20,441
sit tight, I will be right back.

291
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:21,508
Okay.

292
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:25,646
Oh! Whoops! Excuse me.

293
00:11:28,517 --> 00:11:30,517
Sutton, there's some men in reception.

294
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:32,453
Real men. Not models.

295
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:34,455
People with impressive jobs.

296
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,424
Uh, yeah. Right. Whatever.

297
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,726
Uh, do you want me to wait
with the guys in reception?

298
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,561
- I really don't mind.
- That's okay.

299
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:41,595
Just send them over to me.

300
00:11:41,631 --> 00:11:43,731
Okay, if you need anything,

301
00:11:43,766 --> 00:11:45,733
- I am...
- Just send 'em on down.

302
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:47,468
Okay.

303
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,407
Hey. Can I ask you a favor?

304
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,442
- What's up?
- Okay, I was just wondering

305
00:11:55,478 --> 00:11:57,811
if you could take a look at my bio

306
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,648
and make sure it's reading okay
before I give it to Jacqueline.

307
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:02,383
I'd be honored.

308
00:12:02,418 --> 00:12:04,418
Hmm. Hmm.

309
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:06,587
Oh, my God, I...

310
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:08,589
I already hate this.
I could never be a writer.

311
00:12:08,624 --> 00:12:10,290
Well, see, the key is to add

312
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:12,493
- as much detail as possible.
- Okay.

313
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,628
Like, you could add the fact
that you're black.

314
00:12:14,664 --> 00:12:17,297
It'll read something like, "Kat Edison

315
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,734
is 'Scarlet' magazine's
first black female department head."

316
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,671
See, that sounds impressive.

317
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:25,539
Yeah, but it's also irrelevant.

318
00:12:25,574 --> 00:12:26,509
You know, I'm a department head.

319
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,575
That has nothing to do
with the color of my skin.

320
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:30,477
Okay...

321
00:12:30,513 --> 00:12:31,679
it's a big part of who you are.

322
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:34,648
Yeah, but I'm also part white,
and no one asked me to write that down.

323
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:38,419
Not the same thing, but okay.

324
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,181
Uh, any other suggestions?

325
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,254
Yeah... Kat, you have
this really cool opportunity

326
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,189
to be a role model
for young black girls.

327
00:12:45,224 --> 00:12:47,224
Don't you want that?

328
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,327
Why would you ask me that?
Of course I want that.

329
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:53,516
But I want it regardless of my race,
not because of it.

330
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,366
It's what's on the inside that matters.

331
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:58,036
But you're black on the inside too, Kat.

332
00:12:58,071 --> 00:12:59,470
Oh, really?

333
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:04,241
Are... are you questioning
my blackness right now?

334
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,311
Because, uh, up until very recently,

335
00:13:07,346 --> 00:13:09,280
you were wearing khakis and cardigans,

336
00:13:09,315 --> 00:13:13,284
which is just about the whitest
fashion statement imaginable.

337
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,252
That is an interesting projection

338
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:17,154
- of internalized racism.
- Oh, cool.

339
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,224
- So now I'm a racist?
- I didn't say that.

340
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,492
Yeah, you didn't have to.

341
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:32,369
This'll only take a second.

342
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:35,205
Oh, no problem.

343
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:37,274
When in "Scarlet," am I right?

344
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,177
If you're Sutton, then yes.

345
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,547
Why do you get all
the good assignments, Sutton?

346
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,316
It's 'cause men like her.

347
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:48,319
At least that's why
Oliver gave her the job.

348
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:51,155
We're... We're just jealous.

349
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,456
Speak for yourself.

350
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:54,002
Don't listen to them.

351
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:56,421
Oh!

352
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,531
Okay, you're good! You can...

353
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:02,333
put your clothes back on now.

354
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,400
Thank you.

355
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:08,172
Remember: measure twice, cut once.

356
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,246
<i>I just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

357
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,481
<i>so-so-sorry I am.</i>

358
00:14:17,516 --> 00:14:19,249
<i>How sorry I am.</i>

359
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,284
<i>This is Jane-Jane-Jane</i>

360
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,518
<i>Jane-Jane-Jane Sloan.</i>

361
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:23,253
<i>I just wanted to say how sorry...</i>

362
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:24,388
<i>so-so-sorry I am.</i>

363
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:26,290
<i>How sorry I am...</i>

364
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,491
Victoria, I'm...

365
00:14:27,526 --> 00:14:29,460
- I'm so sorry.
- Apparently.

366
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,162
Those words just seem
to flow out of your mouth.

367
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:33,530
I know I screwed up.

368
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:36,200
I should have never
contacted Emma, but...

369
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,501
You did screw up. We just need

370
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:39,236
to change the narrative
and show that "Incite"

371
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:41,205
is a serious publication.

372
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:45,376
I've already booked
an interview on NY14.

373
00:14:46,646 --> 00:14:49,513
Oh, thank you so much
for taking care of this.

374
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:50,629
Me?

375
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:53,550
No. You're going on television,
and it's live.

376
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:58,155
Have we media trained you yet?

377
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,133
No.

378
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,999
Okay, you ready?

379
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,220
I was born ready.

380
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,643
Just another one of the
things I love about you.

381
00:15:13,165 --> 00:15:14,378
Oh!

382
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,646
Coming!

383
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,718
- Hey.
- So good to see you.

384
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,786
Oh...

385
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,823
Hey, babe. Come here.

386
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,177
Hey, missy.

387
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,628
Mom, Dad,

388
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,796
this is Adena.

389
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,531
It's so good to meet you, Adena.

390
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,641
Such a pleasure.

391
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,702
And, uh...

392
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,504
so nice to meet you, Dr. Edison...

393
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,506
- Ah, hey. Marcus.
- Marcus.

394
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,409
Come on, come on.

395
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,222
Wardrobe came in for tomorrow,

396
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:54,618
and unless one of your honorable men
is a pirate...

397
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,520
I must have written the
measurements down wrong.

398
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,819
I thought you grew up
making your own clothes.

399
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,823
Or was that just a story
you sold me to get you hired?

400
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,625
No, I made my entire wardrobe.

401
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Good. Then you can fix this.

402
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,462
And whatever's going on,
for the love of God,

403
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,564
get it together.

404
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,817
- Hi.
- Hi.

405
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:28,719
After you.

406
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,602
Uh, I just realized I forgot something.

407
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,277
I mean, I went to him
for a simple suggestion,

408
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,895
and then he told me that
I should add the fact

409
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:59,062
that I'm the first black
female department head.

410
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:03,453
I just don't really see
how that kind of detail is necessary.

411
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,522
Your bios don't list your race.

412
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,324
Because it has nothing
to do with our ability

413
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,692
- to treat patients.
- Exactly!

414
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:12,596
The color of my skin has no bearing
on my performance as a department head.

415
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,498
No one said it did.

416
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,334
Well, Alex seems to think
it's my responsibility

417
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,469
- or something...
- No, your responsibility

418
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:20,704
- is to be true to yourself
- Yeah.

419
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,539
You don't need labels to do that.

420
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,509
But... why are labels a bad thing?

421
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,446
My bio literally reads,
"proud Muslim lesbian."

422
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,814
It's a part of who I am.

423
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,716
Why wouldn't I want everyone to know?

424
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:37,654
Oh.

425
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:40,390
Excuse me.

426
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,795
You know what, this is Jacqueline,
so I'm just gonna take it real quick.

427
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,564
I'll be right back.

428
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,266
Hi, Jacqueline!

429
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,810
It's important you hit
all the talking points.

430
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,804
Other than admitting you
were wrong to call Emma,

431
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,407
and apologize,
this is not about Jane Sloan.

432
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,609
It's about preserving
the integrity of "Incite."

433
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,545
- It's about?
- Uh, "Incite" being

434
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,780
a hard-hitting,
factually accurate news outlet.

435
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,944
Exactly.

436
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,684
Emma Cox misrepresented
her organization.

437
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,553
How did she misrepresent
her organization?

438
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,142
Uh, by calling the company "charitable,"

439
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,952
even after her product
made a group of homeless women sick.

440
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,593
Remember, "Incite"
chases the stories that matter,

441
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,595
- even when it's difficult.
- And, um...

442
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,664
what if they ask me about

443
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:22,699
why I reached out to apologize to Emma?

444
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,774
Tell the truth.

445
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,636
You're new to "Incite"
and hard-hitting journalism.

446
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,406
And you got too personally invested.

447
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,475
And, Jane, your style.

448
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,711
You're gonna have to lose all of that
for the interview.

449
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:37,814
You're representing "Incite" now.
Not "Scarlet."

450
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:42,369
Of course.

451
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:46,139
So...

452
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:47,507
- she's great, right?
- She is.

453
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,445
- Dad?
- What are her parents like?

454
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,146
Uh...

455
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:54,348
honestly, I don't really know.

456
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,149
I mean, she talks to her mom a lot,

457
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:58,118
but I don't know much about her dad.

458
00:18:58,153 --> 00:19:00,354
I think she left home kind of early.

459
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,322
- That's interesting.
- Oh, please,

460
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,291
do not psychoanalyze my girlfriend.

461
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:05,416
- Marcus.
- No, what?

462
00:19:05,495 --> 00:19:07,394
I mean she's rebellious,
the way she insists

463
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,162
on people knowing who she
is and what she stands for.

464
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:11,331
- Mm-hmm.
- It just seems almost...

465
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,367
- adolescent.
- Okay, how about this?

466
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,369
How about, "Thanks for dinner, Kat."

467
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,471
And, "I'm glad to see you happy."

468
00:19:22,344 --> 00:19:23,631
Thanks for dinner, Kat.

469
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,412
Good night.

470
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:31,084
- I'm so happy you're home.
- Yeah.

471
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
- Love you, baby.
- Bye.

472
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,405
I always thought side-by-side
washer and dryers

473
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,108
were a waste of space until now.

474
00:19:55,144 --> 00:19:56,510
Did you know that women

475
00:19:56,545 --> 00:19:59,313
can have six different kinds...

476
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:01,381
It's not important.

477
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:03,417
- Okay.
- So let me guess.

478
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,584
Another old white guy.

479
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,553
You wanted a woman, right?

480
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:10,223
- We got Cleo Williams.
- The digital fitness mogul?

481
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:12,359
Yeah. Her perspective is impressive,

482
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,228
and since we're revamping
our online image,

483
00:20:15,264 --> 00:20:16,363
made sense to bring her on.

484
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:18,298
Send me her contact info.

485
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,200
I want to welcome her properly.

486
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,506
Your parents seem lovely.

487
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,275
Yeah.

488
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,601
You know, they try.

489
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:32,145
Even though they are psychiatrists.

490
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,482
Well, they didn't mess you up.

491
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,185
Yeah, I hope not.

492
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,487
You know, what I said earlier, um,

493
00:20:40,522 --> 00:20:42,356
about your bio. It's up to you.

494
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,226
- Yeah, I know.
- We all have our own way.

495
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,396
And mine has always been
to put it all out there.

496
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:51,631
I... I can't imagine
living any differently.

497
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,367
But...

498
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:55,302
that's just how I do things.

499
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,170
Doesn't make my way

500
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:01,208
or Alex's way any better
or worse than yours.

501
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,811
Uh, Jacqueline? This is Cleo.

502
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,646
Oh, Cleo!

503
00:21:24,681 --> 00:21:26,214
I'm so happy you could stop by.

504
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,298
Oh, are you kidding?
I am thrilled to finally meet you.

505
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,233
I've been a fan of yours
since I was in my 20s.

506
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:34,303
Well, now you're here
on the board, overseeing "Scarlet."

507
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:36,471
- Mm.
- Uh, please.

508
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:38,240
- Thank you.
- Coffee?

509
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,075
Oh, no, that stuff will kill you.

510
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,412
Well, I am hearing many
wonderful things about you

511
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:44,747
- from the board.
- Oh.

512
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:47,349
- They are very excited.
- Well, I am hugely excited

513
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:51,153
for the opportunity. Particularly,
the chance to expand digital.

514
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:53,255
What made you want to get
into the digital space

515
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:55,057
- to begin with?
- Besides the fact

516
00:21:55,092 --> 00:21:57,359
that it's the future of everything?

517
00:21:57,394 --> 00:21:59,261
You do know that our print magazine

518
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:01,229
sets the trends,
and digital comments on them.

519
00:22:01,265 --> 00:22:04,299
Yes, of course. But, in my experience,

520
00:22:04,335 --> 00:22:07,269
I've seen the power of the internet.

521
00:22:07,304 --> 00:22:10,305
When I first started,
I was just a bored mom,

522
00:22:10,341 --> 00:22:14,009
making these workout videos
to share with my other mom friends.

523
00:22:14,044 --> 00:22:17,145
Now I run a fitness empire
that reaches millions

524
00:22:17,181 --> 00:22:18,480
from the palm of my hand.

525
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:20,449
And it allows me to
have dinner on the table

526
00:22:20,484 --> 00:22:22,217
every night for my family.

527
00:22:22,252 --> 00:22:25,287
I can have my homemade rice cakes
and eat them too, I guess.

528
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:26,912
All while doing squats.

529
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:28,216
And taking selfies.

530
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,325
Should we take one for
my Instagram followers?

531
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:33,428
I think they'd be really
thrilled to see an image of me

532
00:22:33,464 --> 00:22:35,364
with Jacqueline Carlyle.

533
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,032
- Sure.
- Okay.

534
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,516
Sutton, a bit of help?

535
00:22:56,487 --> 00:22:58,120
Uh...

536
00:22:58,155 --> 00:23:00,322
Hands-on, Red.

537
00:23:00,357 --> 00:23:02,991
- Uh, let me help you.
- Yeah.

538
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:14,036
- All right.
- Cool, thanks.

539
00:23:21,245 --> 00:23:22,377
You're only eating the green ones.

540
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:24,079
- What's wrong?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

541
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:25,280
Mm.

542
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:29,117
- How about a Boomerang?
- Okay.

543
00:23:29,153 --> 00:23:31,053
It's social media, be positive.

544
00:23:31,088 --> 00:23:32,287
Red!

545
00:23:34,324 --> 00:23:36,191
- We going with that one?
- That's fine.

546
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:38,293
Mm-hmm.

547
00:23:38,328 --> 00:23:39,461
We have a problem.

548
00:23:39,496 --> 00:23:41,263
Apparently he can deliver a baby

549
00:23:41,298 --> 00:23:43,098
without breaking a sweat,
but ask him to smile

550
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:45,033
for the camera, and he freezes
like a deer in headlights.

551
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:47,235
Go over there and get...
get him to relax,

552
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:49,404
for the love of God.
I need good photographs.

553
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:53,208
I'm a glorified fluffer.

554
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,345
- How's it going, Kat?
- I am getting great snaps.

555
00:23:57,381 --> 00:24:00,449
Good, good. How's your bio coming?

556
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:03,085
Bio. Uh, yeah.

557
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,286
- It's almost done.
- Yeah? Good.

558
00:24:04,321 --> 00:24:06,188
I need it on my desk tomorrow morning.

559
00:24:06,223 --> 00:24:08,123
You got it.

560
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:15,130
Still sitting on that bio, huh?

561
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:17,466
I really don't feel like talking.

562
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:19,334
I didn't mean for things
to get so heated.

563
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,236
Nope, it's all good.

564
00:24:21,271 --> 00:24:24,039
I just thought that you...

565
00:24:24,074 --> 00:24:27,342
you've always been this
super confident badass.

566
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:30,212
You speak your mind.
You stand up for what you want.

567
00:24:30,247 --> 00:24:33,148
Point is, you never back down.

568
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:36,151
Not with your friends,
not your girlfriend,

569
00:24:36,186 --> 00:24:38,320
and definitely not with work.

570
00:24:38,355 --> 00:24:43,391
But when I brought up
adding "black" to your bio,

571
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:45,227
a wall goes up?

572
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:51,266
Yeah, you're right.

573
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:01,042
Do you know how everyone
always wants to...

574
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:03,211
be able to put you in a box, right?

575
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:04,346
- Mm-hmm.
- Black, white,

576
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:06,248
girl, boy.

577
00:25:06,283 --> 00:25:09,184
Even those standardized tests
they make you take as a kid.

578
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,086
You know,
where you have to fill in the bubbles?

579
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:16,024
I remember getting to the section
that says, "Select your race,

580
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:17,392
Caucasian or African-American,"

581
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:19,027
you don't have any other choice...

582
00:25:19,062 --> 00:25:21,329
and thinking...

583
00:25:21,365 --> 00:25:23,064
like, how do I pick?

584
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,201
I mean, 'cause if...

585
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:29,104
if I pick, uh...

586
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:31,439
if I pick black,
then I'm rejecting my mom.

587
00:25:31,475 --> 00:25:35,243
And if I pick white,
then I'm rejecting my dad.

588
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
So what did you pick?

589
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:40,348
Well, actually, I just left it blank.

590
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:44,486
It was easier to deny
both than to pick one.

591
00:25:44,521 --> 00:25:46,454
But...

592
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,291
you're not a kid anymore.

593
00:25:49,326 --> 00:25:52,093
And standing up for who you are matters.

594
00:25:54,097 --> 00:25:55,263
Yeah, I know.

595
00:26:08,045 --> 00:26:10,011
Chad Horford. Nice to meet you.

596
00:26:10,047 --> 00:26:11,313
Jane Sloan.

597
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:13,114
You're nervous. Don't be nervous.

598
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,382
It's the first time I've done
something like this.

599
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:17,185
Ah, don't worry about it. It'll be good.

600
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,353
We're on air in two seconds.

601
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:23,992
Hello, New York.
If you're a fan of "Incite,"

602
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:26,194
then you've probably
heard of Jane Sloan,

603
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:29,264
best known for her apology
to OTR's Emma Cox

604
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,266
that went viral. Now, Jane is here

605
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:34,336
to set the record straight
in her own words.

606
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:36,304
- Thank you for having me.
- We have a full slate,

607
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,306
so let's get right to it.
You wrote an article

608
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,208
on Emma Cox, which,

609
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:42,444
according to your now
very public apology,

610
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,279
was heavily edited.

611
00:26:44,314 --> 00:26:46,214
So what happened?

612
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,217
Is "Incite" fabricating their stories?

613
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:50,172
No.

614
00:26:50,254 --> 00:26:54,289
"Incite" is a hard-hitting,
factually accurate news outlet.

615
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:58,126
She misrepresented her company
as a charitable organization,

616
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:00,328
and "Incite" readers
deserve to hear that story

617
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:01,363
as much as anything else.

618
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:06,034
Even though it caused her
to lose funding for her company?

619
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:08,303
I allowed myself to get
too personally invested

620
00:27:08,338 --> 00:27:10,071
in Emma Cox.

621
00:27:10,107 --> 00:27:11,373
Hmm. I'm sure there are a lot

622
00:27:11,408 --> 00:27:13,441
of aspiring journalists
watching right now

623
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,210
who appreciate your candor.

624
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:17,045
Well, there you have it.
Setting the record straight,

625
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,047
that's Jane Sloan. We'll be right back

626
00:27:19,082 --> 00:27:20,148
- to meet New York's...
- I'm sorry,

627
00:27:20,183 --> 00:27:21,983
if I could just say...

628
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:24,452
Um...

629
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:28,223
I do think that Emma Cox
is making great strides for women.

630
00:27:28,258 --> 00:27:30,325
She is revolutionizing feminine hygiene.

631
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,094
Her cups are eco-friendly
and affordable.

632
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:34,462
Okay, are... are you saying...

633
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:37,432
I'm saying that she made one mistake:

634
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:42,203
not recognizing the sanitary conditions
needed for her product.

635
00:27:42,239 --> 00:27:44,105
But people make mistakes.

636
00:27:44,141 --> 00:27:46,241
And if they're good people,
they course-correct.

637
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:48,410
Which Emma did,
when she made new disposable cups

638
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,412
for less optimal conditions.

639
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:54,316
So, "Incite" was factually inaccurate.

640
00:27:57,287 --> 00:28:00,355
I think that we're all so quick
to take each other down,

641
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,992
to find someone to blame.

642
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:06,061
"Incite" is not all right or all wrong,

643
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:09,164
just like Emma Cox is not
all good or all bad.

644
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:11,132
And when we sensationalize people

645
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:15,303
for the purpose of getting more eyes
on a story, that story gets lost.

646
00:28:15,339 --> 00:28:17,038
Okay, then.

647
00:28:17,074 --> 00:28:19,140
Something for all of us to think about.

648
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,076
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

649
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,310
We'll be right back.

650
00:28:22,346 --> 00:28:24,279
And, we're clear.

651
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:26,047
That was great.

652
00:28:36,027 --> 00:28:38,061
This guy needs to relax.

653
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:39,295
What do you think?

654
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:43,132
How's it going?

655
00:28:43,168 --> 00:28:44,934
I don't feel like myself at all.

656
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,070
I know exactly what you mean.

657
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:49,906
You're on display. You're being judged.

658
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:51,074
I don't know about that.

659
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:52,208
It's not a good feeling.

660
00:28:52,243 --> 00:28:56,112
Red!

661
00:28:56,147 --> 00:28:57,347
What the hell is going on?

662
00:28:57,382 --> 00:28:59,182
Okay, you can't take
simple measurements,

663
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:00,917
you can't fix a guy's tie,

664
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,151
and that guy looks
more uncomfortable now

665
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:03,286
than when I asked you to talk to him.

666
00:29:03,321 --> 00:29:05,989
Oliver. Let me handle this.

667
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:16,132
- What's wrong?
- Um...

668
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,335
some of the assistants found out
about me and Alex.

669
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:22,171
And you went through the
proper HR channel, so...

670
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:24,874
No, I know. We're not together.

671
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:26,943
Not since you caught
us in the stairwell.

672
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:28,978
Oh.

673
00:29:29,014 --> 00:29:31,914
Okay, um...

674
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,950
so what's the problem?

675
00:29:35,954 --> 00:29:38,021
When the assistants found out,

676
00:29:38,056 --> 00:29:40,597
they started to talk
about Alex giving me

677
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,159
preferential treatment.

678
00:29:43,194 --> 00:29:45,962
That's not why I was
getting the assignments.

679
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,231
- I know that.
- No, of course not.

680
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:52,168
But then Oliver assigned
me this photo shoot.

681
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:54,037
He could have picked anybody,

682
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:57,974
and he chose me because he thinks
that I work well with men.

683
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:02,979
I felt people in the office
judging me for that.

684
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:06,049
And I started to second-guess

685
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:09,185
how I carry myself, and how I...

686
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,220
- use my sexuality...
- Sutton.

687
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,023
You are a people person.

688
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:16,959
And men are people.

689
00:30:17,438 --> 00:30:19,962
It's that simple.

690
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:21,330
It's just with everything
that's been going on lately...

691
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:23,266
Yes, it is undoubtedly...

692
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:25,935
a very complicated time
for men and women

693
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,403
in the workplace.

694
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,238
I mean, as stories continue to come out,

695
00:30:29,274 --> 00:30:32,942
we're all checking ourselves,
but we cannot lose sight

696
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,310
of who we truly are.

697
00:30:34,345 --> 00:30:39,082
And we cannot dim our light
that makes us special.

698
00:30:39,117 --> 00:30:42,051
You have a magnetic personality, Sutton.

699
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:44,087
That is a good thing.

700
00:30:45,858 --> 00:30:48,124
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

701
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,059
Okay.

702
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:52,295
Okay.

703
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,064
Now, you get back out there,

704
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,300
and make that person...

705
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,069
...photogenic, please.

706
00:31:00,105 --> 00:31:01,938
I'm on it.

707
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:06,309
Okay, Ben. You want to finish this up,

708
00:31:06,344 --> 00:31:08,077
I'm here to help you make that happen.

709
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:10,246
- Let's talk, just me and you.
- Okay.

710
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:11,347
Okay.

711
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:13,349
Question number one:

712
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:14,984
why are you doing this?

713
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,285
It's good press for the clinic.

714
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:19,088
Mm-hmm. So is taking out an ad.

715
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:20,289
What are you not telling me?

716
00:31:20,325 --> 00:31:22,024
Did you lose a bet?

717
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,093
- I don't gamble.
- Really?

718
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,928
But if you must know,
I have a list of things

719
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:28,064
- that make me uncomfortable.
- A list.

720
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,366
So what, like a reverse bucket list?

721
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,201
Mm-hmm. Being photographed

722
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,402
- is one of them.
- Okay.

723
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:36,944
- So you enjoy being uncomfortable.
- No, I hate it.

724
00:31:37,242 --> 00:31:39,375
But it reminds me that I'm alive, so...

725
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:42,178
Alive and uncomfortable?

726
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,380
That sounds terrible.

727
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:46,315
- It does, doesn't it?
- Yes!

728
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:48,184
That is so weird.

729
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:49,285
I'm just kidding.

730
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:52,989
That's it. All right.

731
00:31:53,024 --> 00:31:55,224
Got it. Next.

732
00:31:58,229 --> 00:32:00,930
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Of course.

733
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:02,198
Everything okay?

734
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah.

735
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,002
Yep.

736
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:08,337
What is it?

737
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:11,007
Why are we...

738
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:13,309
so against labeling ourselves?

739
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,348
Uh, well, I guess it's because
your mother and I, we feel that, um,

740
00:32:19,384 --> 00:32:24,053
it's what's on the inside that matters.

741
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:27,356
Right, but...

742
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,292
I kind of think it's more than that.

743
00:32:33,331 --> 00:32:36,933
The other night, you asked me...

744
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:40,336
about Adena's parents.

745
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:43,306
So what about your parents, Dad?

746
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:46,209
I mean I know everything
about grandma and grandpa.

747
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,177
But...

748
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:52,114
I don't know anything
about Dad's side of the family.

749
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:55,084
So why is that?

750
00:33:00,258 --> 00:33:03,059
My childhood was a lot different
from yours, Kat.

751
00:33:03,094 --> 00:33:05,127
I grew up with blacks
on one side of the city

752
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:07,029
and whites on the other.

753
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:09,031
And the label of race?

754
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:12,335
We didn't want that for you.

755
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,239
And I don't think we did such a bad job.

756
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:19,041
You're confident. You're successful.

757
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:22,345
Everything you guys are saying...

758
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,046
kind of just feels like a way to avoid

759
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:27,917
really talking about it, and I'm trying
to understand why.

760
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,087
Maybe it's my fault.

761
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,259
When you were little,

762
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:39,028
and I would take you to the park,

763
00:33:39,063 --> 00:33:41,998
people assumed you
weren't biologically mine.

764
00:33:45,003 --> 00:33:49,405
Maybe I avoided labels because
I just wanted to be your mom.

765
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,308
I didn't want to be your white mom.

766
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:02,251
Sweetheart...

767
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:04,287
if we ever made you feel

768
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,123
that you cannot take
ownership of who you are...

769
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:11,327
that was not our intention.

770
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:17,900
You're a grown woman.

771
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,235
You're beautiful,

772
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,238
smart, strong...

773
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,275
These are your choices to make.

774
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:27,944
Not ours.

775
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:35,151
Nice work today, Red.

776
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,920
Good to have you back.

777
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:44,093
Hey, Jane. How'd it go?

778
00:34:44,128 --> 00:34:45,361
<i>Well, I went off script,</i>

779
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:47,964
<i>so I'm not entirely sure.</i>

780
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:51,133
But I feel good about it,
so that's something.

781
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,235
- How was the shoot?
- You know what?

782
00:34:53,271 --> 00:34:56,205
I love men. And men love me.

783
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,207
And there's nothing wrong with that.

784
00:34:58,242 --> 00:35:00,109
Well, that's cause for celebration.

785
00:35:00,144 --> 00:35:03,079
- Should we get drinks?
- You read my mind.

786
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:05,014
There's just one thing
I have to do first.

787
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:06,349
Kay.

788
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:10,252
Hey, Mitzi.

789
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:13,122
So this slut-shaming thing you're doing.

790
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:14,357
- It's got to stop.
- I wasn't...

791
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:16,025
You were.

792
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,029
I know it, and, unfortunately,
a few of the assistants also know it.

793
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:21,364
But we don't tear each other down.

794
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:23,132
Not as women.

795
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:25,334
And definitely not
as women of "Scarlet."

796
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,937
If you want some competition,
I'm totally up for that,

797
00:35:27,972 --> 00:35:29,305
but it has to be based
on merit and talent,

798
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:32,041
and not petty gossip.

799
00:35:32,076 --> 00:35:34,043
- Got it?
- Got it.

800
00:35:34,078 --> 00:35:36,912
Cool. Hey, guys!

801
00:35:36,948 --> 00:35:38,247
- Who wants to get a drink?
- Let's do it.

802
00:35:38,282 --> 00:35:41,384
- Yeah.
- Is that on your list?

803
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:52,199
Cheers!

804
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:57,204
Okay, how great
did everybody feel today?

805
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,040
- Awesome.
- You looked great.

806
00:35:59,075 --> 00:36:01,042
You looked great, you looked great,

807
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,044
- and you looked great.
- Well, thank you.

808
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,846
Come here.

809
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:08,983
There's somebody that
I want you to meet.

810
00:36:09,018 --> 00:36:10,217
- Hi.
- Hi, Jane.

811
00:36:10,253 --> 00:36:12,186
This is Ben. Ben, this is Jane.

812
00:36:12,221 --> 00:36:13,854
Oh, my God!

813
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,056
You guys are both great people,

814
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,858
who like to make really
weird to-do lists.

815
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,880
Thank you for the awkward introduction.

816
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:24,098
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

817
00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:27,802
Uh, so...

818
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,136
- Drinks.
- Yeah.

819
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:35,142
Hello.

820
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,144
Do you want to talk?

821
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,246
Yeah, but not right now.

822
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:41,582
Right now, I want to drink.

823
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,151
I can make that happen. Bartender!

824
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:47,822
- Tequila or tequila?
- Tequila.

825
00:36:48,215 --> 00:36:49,256
Thank you.

Hey.

841
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:30,064
Hey, morning.

842
00:37:30,099 --> 00:37:31,832
You going to work already?

843
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,834
Yeah, I, uh...

844
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,004
promised Jacqueline I'd have
my bio in first thing, so...

845
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:42,143
These things can be hard to look at.

846
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,845
Yeah...

847
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:49,083
and especially when you've been raised
with rose-colored glasses.

848
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:50,851
Your parents...

849
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:54,822
they did what they believed
was best for you at the time.

850
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,293
Yeah, I know.

851
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:06,901
But I also know that I chose
to keep those glasses on.

852
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,803
Long after I moved out.

853
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:11,806
Kat, it's...

854
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:13,841
it's okay.

855
00:38:16,813 --> 00:38:17,982
Come here.

856
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,128
_

857
00:38:48,643 --> 00:38:51,212
Hey. Thanks.

858
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,849
So what did you choose?

859
00:38:54,884 --> 00:39:00,020
I am "Scarlet" magazine's
first black female department head.

860
00:39:00,056 --> 00:39:01,440
Sounds impressive.

861
00:39:03,826 --> 00:39:06,093
And I'm so proud to be biracial.

862
00:39:06,129 --> 00:39:08,028
But...

863
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:13,134
for right now, it feels important
to embrace this part of myself.

864
00:39:15,037 --> 00:39:18,038
Hold that!

865
00:39:18,074 --> 00:39:20,040
Thanks. Oh, good morning, Richard.

866
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:21,775
Jacqueline.

867
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,878
- You get a chance to meet Cleo?
- I did.

868
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,045
And...

869
00:39:25,081 --> 00:39:28,215
She won't be joining our poker night,
if that's what you're asking.

870
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:30,784
But I think she'll be
an asset to the board.

871
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,053
And a fresh perspective.

872
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:36,223
Still wish you were
riding to the top with me.

873
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:38,792
Maybe one day, Richard. Not yet.

874
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,909
<i>Hi, Jacqueline, it's Cleo.</i>

875
00:39:54,944 --> 00:39:57,845
<i>I just saw the layout
for next month's issue.</i>

876
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,980
<i>It's gorgeous. Had a few thoughts.</i>

877
00:40:00,016 --> 00:40:01,815
<i>Call me, let's discuss.</i>

878
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,189
- Victoria?
- Just the person

879
00:40:08,224 --> 00:40:10,824
I wanted to see. Have a seat.

880
00:40:12,094 --> 00:40:13,894
We all make mistakes.

881
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,996
The important thing is
that we learn from them.

882
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,865
Yes, uh,

883
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:21,202
that's exactly what I was going for
with my angle on Emma Cox.

884
00:40:21,237 --> 00:40:23,170
I made a mistake recently...

885
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:26,073
when I thought you would
be a good fit for "Incite."

886
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,209
But I...

887
00:40:28,244 --> 00:40:30,110
It was... it was a good interview, I...

888
00:40:30,146 --> 00:40:33,214
I did what you said.
I hit all my talking points.

889
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:36,884
Jane, you went on television
to represent "Incite."

890
00:40:36,919 --> 00:40:38,219
- You made it about yourself.
- No, I...

891
00:40:38,254 --> 00:40:39,286
I was trying to make a point...

892
00:40:39,322 --> 00:40:41,055
Jane. Stop.

893
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,890
You're fired.

894
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:16,192
